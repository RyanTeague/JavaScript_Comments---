    <!--JavaScript Comments
    
        JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and to 
        make it more readable.

        JavaScript comments can also be used to prevent execution, when 
        testing alternative code.
    -->

    <!--Single Line Comments
    
        Single line comments start with //.

        Any text between // and the end of the line will be ignored by JavaScript 
        (will not be executed).

        This example uses a single-line comment before each code line:
    -->
    <h1 id="myH"></h1>
    <p id="myP"></p>

    <script>
    // Change heading:
    document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "JavaScript Comments";
    // Change paragraph:
    document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";
    </script>

    <hr>

    <!--This example uses a single line comment at the end of each line to explain 
        the code:
    -->
    <h2>JavaScript Comments</h2>

    <p id="demo"></p>
    
    <script>
    let x = 5;      // Declare x, give it the value of 5
    let y = x + 2;  // Declare y, give it the value of x + 2 
    
    // Write y to demo:
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = y;
    </script>

    <hr>

    <!--Mulit-line Comments
    
        Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.

        Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by JavaScript.

        This example uses a multi-line comment (a comment block) to explain the 
        code:
    -->
    <h1 id="myH"></h1>
    <p id="myP"></p>
    
    <script>
    /*
    The code below will change
    the heading with id = "myH"
    and the paragraph with id = "myP"
    */
    document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "JavaScript Comments";
    document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";
    </script>

    <hr>

    <!--It is most common to use single line comments.
    
        Block comments are often used for formal documnetation.

    -->

    <!--Using Comments to PRevent Execution
    
        Using comments to prevent execution of code is suitable for code testing.

        Adding // in front of a code line changes the code lines from an executable 
        line to a comment.

        This example uses // to prevent execution of one of the code lines:
    -->
    <h2>JavaScript Comments</h2>

    <h1 id="myH"></h1>
    
    <p id="myP"></p>
    
    <script>
    //document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";
    document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";
    </script>
    
    <p>The line starting with // is not executed.</p>

    <!--This example uses a comment block to prevent execution of mulitiple lines:-->
    <h2>JavaScript Comments</h2>

    <h1 id="myH"></h1>

    <p id="myP"></p>

    <script>
    /*
    document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "Welcome to my Homepage";
    document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "This is my first paragraph.";
    */
    document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "The comment-block is not executed.";
    </script>
